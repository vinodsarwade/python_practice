"""
the basic idea of object oriented programming in python is to use classes and objects to represents 
real world concept and entities.. 
a class is a blueprint of templats for creating a object.
it defines a properties and and methods that an object of a class will have.
properties are a data or state of an object and methods are the action and behaviour that an object can perform.


an object is a instance of a class and it contains it's own data and methods.

ex:you could create a class called "person" and that has properties such as name and age and methods are speak() and walk().
each instance of a person class would be unique object with it's own name and age,but they all have same methods to speak and walk.
